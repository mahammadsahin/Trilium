    <p>The main concept that unites all versions of UNIX is the following four
      basics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kernel
        <ul>
          <li>The Kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with hardware
            and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling &amp; file
            management</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>shell:
        <ul>
          <li>The shell is the utility that processes you requests. When you type in
            a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls
            the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all</li>
          <li>commands. C shell, bourns shell, and kern shell are most famous shells
            which are available with most of the Unix variants</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>commands &amp; utilities:
        <ul>
          <li>There are various command &amp; utilities which you would use in your
            day to day activities, cp, mv, cat, &amp; grep etc, are few examples of
            commands and utilities. There are over 250 standard commands plus numerous
            others provided through 3rd party software. All the commands come along
            with various optional options</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Files &amp; Directories
        <ul>
          <li>All data is UNIX is organized into files. All files are organized into
            directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure
            called the filesystem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6><span class="text-big">Unix File System</span></h6>
    <p style="margin-left:40px;">A file in UNIX is a sqpuence of bytes. Unix troats everything it knows
      and understands, as a file. All utilities, applications, data in unix is
      stored as files. Even a directory is treated as a file which contains several
      other files&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px;">Unix has a hierarchical file structure</p>
    <p style="margin-left:40px;">/(Root)</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/dev - The <strong>dev</strong> directory contains files that control various
      input/output devices like terminals printer, disk drives etc. For each
      device there is a separate file</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">console</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">Ipo</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/bin - The <strong>bin </strong>directory contains executable files for
      most of the Unix commands, Unix commands can be either C programs or shell
      programs</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">sh</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">csh</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/tmp - The <strong>tmp</strong> directory contains the temporary files created
      by unix or by the users. The <strong>etc</strong> contains binary executable
      files usually required for system administrator</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/usr - In the <strong>usr</strong> directory there are several directories,
      each associated with a particular user. Within the <strong>usr</strong> directory
      there is another <strong>bin</strong> directory contains addirional unix
      command files</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">User 1</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">User 2</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">bin</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/etc</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">password</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">group</p>
    <p style="margin-left:120px;">init</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/lib - the <strong>lib</strong> directory contains all the library functions
      provided by unix for users</p>
    <p style="margin-left:80px;">/UNIX</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h6><span class="text-big"><strong>Unix vs Linxu</strong></span></h6>
    <p>Unix is CLI &amp; Linux is GUI</p>
    <p>Unix need special Hardware</p>
    <p>Unix is very costly &amp; Not open source</p>
    <p>Unix file system is GPS, xfs, vxfs, windows file system support</p>
    <p>Unix hard to install &amp; not protable</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Apple MAC &amp; Linux kernel based on UNIX</p>
